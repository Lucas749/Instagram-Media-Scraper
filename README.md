# Instagram-Picture-Scraper
Script downloads pictures from instagram accounts. The script uses selenium and chrome to retrieve the html source code as regular requests fail to fetch the whole source code due to instagram's react framwork.

# How to use the script
1. Specify folder location and chromedriver path in the script
2. Run script and type in instagram usernames

# NOTE: Please do not misuse this script. This program was created as a fun project to familiarize myself with web scraping.
