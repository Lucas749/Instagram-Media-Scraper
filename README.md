# Instagram-Media-Scraper
Script downloads pictures and videos from instagram accounts. The script also works for private accounts and requests your instagram log-in data in order to access the specific media. The code uses selenium and chrome to retrieve the html source code as regular requests fail to fetch the whole source code due to instagram's react framwork.

1. Specify folder location and chromedriver path in the script
2. Run script and type in instagram usernames

# NOTE: Please do not misuse this script. This program was created as a fun project during the Coronavirus outbreak to familiarize myself with web scraping.
